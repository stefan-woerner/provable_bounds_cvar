Python code and data.

Get started by `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which should finish in a few seconds.

Results for Figures 1, 3, 4 and Tables 1 & 2 can be found in the two notebooks:
- 40-qubits / 40_qubit_qaoa.ipynb
- 127-qubits / 127_qubit_qaoa.ipynb

The tutorials contain the data to generate the results as well as the code to reproduce the data, given access to the IBM Quantum platform.
