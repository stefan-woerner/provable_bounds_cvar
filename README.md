Python code and data.

Get started by `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which should finish in a few seconds.

Results for Figures 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Tables 1 & 2 can be found in the two notebooks:
- [fidelity / fidelity_estimation_50_qubits.ipynb](https://github.com/stefan-woerner/provable_bounds_cvar/blob/revision/fidelity/fidelity_estimation_50_qubits.ipynb)
- [fidelity / fidelity_estimation_100_qubits.ipynb](https://github.com/stefan-woerner/provable_bounds_cvar/blob/revision/fidelity/fidelity_estimation_100_qubits.ipynb)

The tutorials contain the data to generate the results as well as the code to reproduce the data, given access to the IBM Quantum platform.
